Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns? 
  Three conclusions are that most of them are successful. That throughout the years, campaigns are relatively consistent in the number of canceled, failed, and successful campaigns. And that theatre and plays are the most popular genre.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
  There may be more successful campaigns in a certain Category, but it does not equate to how much money or attention the campaign collected compared to others.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
  We could use a Box and Whiskers plot to see if there are any outliers in the dataset. 

Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
  Since the distribution is skewed in standard deviation, median is the best measure of central tendency

Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
  The higher number the standard deviation, the more variability that data set is, so using that logic, successful campagins has more variability.
